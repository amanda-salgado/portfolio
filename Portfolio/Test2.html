    <h1>Images and Links</h1>   
    <p>We are going to discuss how to put images and links on a page. We will discuss several types of links. Also, how to make clickable images.</p>

<h2>External Links</h2>
<p>There are several types of links. There are internal, external, and local. An external link goes outside the server, meaning to another website.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target = "_blank">W3Schools</a></li>
    <li><a href = "https://girlswhocode.com/" target = "_blank">Girls Who Code</a></li>
    <li><a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code" target = "_blank">Code Academy</a> </li>
</ul>
<h2>Local Links</h2>
<p>Local links lead to another page within your site. It is usually the navigation to direct you to another webpage. The Navigation links are usually at the top of the page or down the left side.</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Use the img tag or an image. The src attribute allows you to put in the image file. The alt is for accesibility.</p>
<img src = "Images/tech-moms-logo.png" alt="Tech Moms Logo">

<h2>Links within text</h2>
<p>To use a word as a link, just put the tags before and after the word. Such as if I wanted to link to <a href = "https://www.tech-moms.org/" alt="Tech Moms Logo" width="100" target = "_blank">Tech-Moms</a>, I could just put tags in this paragraph.</p>
